# block websites that you know distract you â›”

I would like to share with you a simple productivity trick that I use to block distracting websites on macOS.
Whenever I try to access them, I see the following message: "This site canâ€™t be reached".

There are few options to achieve this. FYI, Chrome extensions don't work for me because they're too easy to disable with just 2 clicks. 
My approach forces me to go through a few more steps to unblock a 
website such as opening a terminal, recalling the command, editing some files, and saving them.
This extra effort makes me rethink my decision before proceeding ðŸ˜‰
<br/>
<br/>
To block websites, follow these steps:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```ts
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
<br/>

2. Add the websites, which youâ€™d like to block, e.g.:

```ts 
127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com
127.0.0.1 www.x.com
127.0.0.1 www.tiktok.com
```
<br/>

Check if the websites are blocked in your browser. If it doesnâ€™t work, try checking in incognito mode. You may also need to remove all cookies for those websites and flush the DNS cache with the following command:

```ts
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
```


<br/>

This method has helped me avoid using Facebook, TikTok, and other distracting websites altogether. I hope it works for you too! ðŸš€
