        This productivity hack taught my brain that distracting
        websites are not available, so I don't even try to open them anymore.
        So whenever you try to visit these websites, you'll see "This site can't be reached", which is exactly what
        I need.
        <br><br>
        By the way, web extensions don't work for me because they're too easy to remove. With this method,
        I have to go into the terminal, remind what was the command, edit some files, and save them, which takes more
        time and makes me rethink my
        decision before doing it.
